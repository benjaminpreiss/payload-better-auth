 * Minimal key-value storage interface for Better Auth + Payload synchronization.

 * This interface is intentionally simple - just get/set/delete operations.
 * The plugins handle higher-level concerns (timestamps, sessions, nonces) internally.
 *
 * Compatible with better-auth's SecondaryStorage interface.
